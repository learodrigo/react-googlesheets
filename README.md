Hey! Check out this, is quiet nice way to connect to your spreadsheets via API. For the whole explanation, check this [tutorial from freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/react-and-googlesheets/) I followed from [@nishant-666](https://github.com/nishant-666). It's pretty well explained and super fast to do.

## tl;dr

For this you need an access to a Drive to create the file, obviously, and to register for free in [sheet.best](https://sheet.best/), sheet.best turns spreadsheets into REST APIs for you to connect it to anything. Simple and fast, start now and see the possibilities.

Also here's the [documentation](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-custom-environment-variables/#adding-development-environment-variables-in-env) for handling .env with `create-react-app`

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
